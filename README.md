# ğŸŒ± Hello!
 
My name is Tobias Vonderheidt - but you can call me Tobi :)

## ğŸ™ˆ What do I do?

I study Computer Science at TU Darmstadt - with a passion for privacy and security. Learn about my personal project at [decipher.pw](https://decipher.pw).

In my free time, I love taking photos - especially portraits. Take a look at my portfolio at [juicy.photo](https://juicy.photo).

## ğŸ“¬ Say hello!

I speak ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª and ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§, bits of ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹ and might even remember a little ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· - so that as many people as possible can contact me!
